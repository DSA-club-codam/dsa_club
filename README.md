## How It Works

### Repository Structure
- **`main` branch** – managed by admins, contains tasks and materials
- **Your personal branch** – name it `your-nickname`, push your solutions here

### Workflow
1. **Get new tasks:** `git pull origin main`
2. **Solve problems** in your branch
3. **Push to YOUR branch:** `git push origin your-nickname`
